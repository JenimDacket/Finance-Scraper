This is a basic web scraper that accesses the main google finance page to:
- scrape the best and worst equities of each sector, with percentage change
- scrape the percentage change for each sector
- returns all data in a json string

- easily scalable to grab top 5/ bottom 5 performers in each sector

Very limited functionality program.
